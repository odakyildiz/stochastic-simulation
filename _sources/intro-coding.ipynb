    "It is then a good idea to learn a few tricks about fixing random states. As we mentioned in the course, pseudorandom numbers often have a _seed_ that can be used to reproduce the same sequence of numbers. This is very useful for debugging purposes. For example, if you want to check that your code is working as expected, you can fix the seed and check that the output is the same as the one you obtained before. This is also useful for sharing your code with others, as they can reproduce your results."
